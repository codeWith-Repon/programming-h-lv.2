### What is an event module?

The events module in Node.js is a built-in module that allows you to create, listen for, and respond to custom events in your application. It follows the event-driven architecture pattern, which is a core part of how Node.js works ‚Äî especially since it's non-blocking and asynchronous.

### Why use the events module?

Imagine you want some code to run only after a specific action happens ‚Äî like when a user logs in, a file finishes loading, or a server finishes starting. Instead of constantly checking, you just listen for an event ‚Äî and when that event happens, Node.js emits it, and your listener reacts.

### Basic Usage Example

```bash
#  Import the events module
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');

```

output:

```bash
an event occurred!
```

üîÑ Explanation

- EventEmitter is a class provided by Node.js in the events module.
- .on('eventName', callback) sets up a listener ‚Äî a function to run when the event happens.
- .emit('eventName') triggers the event, causing all attached listeners to run.

Real-world Example

- In a real-world Node.js app:
- When a file upload finishes ‚Üí emitter.emit('uploadComplete')
- When a user signs in ‚Üí emitter.emit('userLoggedIn', userData)
- When data is received from a stream ‚Üí stream emits a 'data' event

### Synchronous way to read and write files

In Node.js, to read and write files synchronously, you use the built-in fs module (File System module). The synchronous methods block the execution until the file operation is complete ‚Äî which can be useful for small tasks, configuration files, or scripts that run once and exit.

```bash
const fs = require('fs');
# write file
console.log('task 1');

const txt = 'Learning file system';
fs.writeFileSync('./hello.txt', txt);

console.log('task 2');

# read file
const data = fs.readFileSync('./hello.txt', { encoding: 'utf-8' });

console.log('task 3');

console.log(data);
```

### asynchronous way to read and write files

Asynchronous functions don‚Äôt block the program ‚Äî they let the rest of your code run while the file task completes in the background. This is the preferred method for most real-world applications.

```bash
console.log('task 1');

fs.writeFile('./hello.txt', 'Learning node', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('file write successfully');
});

fs.readFile('./hello.txt', { encoding: 'utf-8' }, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('somthing went wrong', err);
    return;
  }

  console.log(data);
});

console.log('task 3');
```

### Buffer and Streaming

Buffer: It is used to process a data piece by piece which is called buffer.

A Buffer is a temporary memory location used to store binary data (like images, files, etc.) ‚Äî especially useful when dealing with streams or data coming from external sources like file systems or networks.

Example: Create and log a buffer

```bash
const buffer = Buffer.from('Hello, Buffer!');
console.log(buffer);            #Raw bytes
console.log(buffer.toString()); #Convert back to string
```

Why Use Buffers?

- Node.js deals with binary data (e.g., from files, TCP streams, etc.).
- Buffers let you process raw binary data directly.
- They're especially useful in streams when data comes in chunks.

### What is Streaming in Node.js?

Streaming means reading or writing data piece by piece (chunk by chunk) instead of loading the whole file into memory at once. This is memory-efficient and faster for large files.

Common Stream Types

- Readable: For reading data (e.g., file, HTTP request, fs.readStream)
- Writable: For writing data (e.g., file, HTTP response, fs.writeStream)
- Duplex: Both read and write
- Transform: Modify data during streaming (e.g., compression)
